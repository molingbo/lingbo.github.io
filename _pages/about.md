I am Lingbo Mo, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) (OSU) advised by [Prof. Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/). Prior to joining OSU, I received my M.S. in the School of Information and Communication Engineering at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT).

## Research Interest

My research interests lie in natural language processing, question answering, interactive semantic parsing, vision and language.
